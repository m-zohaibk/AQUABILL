/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Water Supply App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where each user has complete control over their own data and cannot access data belonging to other users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data (customers, invoices, settings) is nested under the `/users/{userId}` path. This ensures that each user's data is isolated from other users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed as there are no rules governing the `/users` collection itself.
 * - The rules strictly enforce path-based ownership, meaning the `userId` in the path must always match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - No data validation beyond ownership is enforced in this initial prototyping phase to allow for schema flexibility.
 * - Since the application uses path-based ownership and does not have complex role-based access control, no denormalization is needed.
