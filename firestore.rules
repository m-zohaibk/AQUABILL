/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset allows unrestricted access to all data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The application requires no authorization restrictions, so all read and write operations are allowed for all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Stores customer data.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/invoices/{invoiceId}: Stores invoices associated with a specific customer.
 * - /settings/{settingId}: Stores application settings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No access restrictions are enforced. All users can read and write all data.
