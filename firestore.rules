/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Water Supply App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has a dedicated data tree under `/users/{userId}`.
 * Only the authenticated user matching the `userId` can read and write data within their respective tree.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data (customers, invoices, settings) is nested under `/users/{userId}`. This structure simplifies
 * authorization by aligning data access directly with user identity.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed by the path-based ownership model.
 * - There are no global admin roles. Each user has full control over their own data.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow rapid prototyping but includes checks on relational integrity where appropriate.
 * - No data denormalization is required as the path based ownership is enough to write secure and performant rules.
