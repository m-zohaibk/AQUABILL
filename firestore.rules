/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Water Supply App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where each user has exclusive
 * access to their own data, stored under their unique user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data (customers, invoices, settings) is nested under the /users/{userId} path.
 * This structure simplifies the security rules and ensures data isolation.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - All write operations are restricted to the owner of the data, based on the path.
 * - The rules do not enforce a specific schema, but they do enforce that the
 *   userId in the path matches the authenticated user's UID for data consistency,
 *   especially on create operations.
 * - No denormalization of data is needed as only the user themselves can access the data.
